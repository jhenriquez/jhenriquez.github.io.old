          Crafting software has been my trade for about 5 years now using Microsoft.NET and SQL Server. Enjoying the most working on ASP.NET MVC and Web API.

          An experienced C# programmer, yet I'm always looking for ways to enhance the quality of my code, most of the time by making it more testable, sometimes making it look better, more readable and easier to understand. This has led me through the arduous path of studying and internalizing patterns, practices and principles which I still walk today.
        </p>

          Recently I've been captured by a growing love for the JavaScript language and the flexibility and power offered by tools like NodeJS and frameworks like AngularJS.

              Building the Internet of Things with Raco Wireless has been, so far, a great ride. It has solidified my experience and has been a paradigm changer with regards to actual solution delivery and customer relations. Because of our business to business model I've enhanced my capacity to communicate and provide clients with what would bring them more value.

                Working in the ministry was a very interesting period of my career. I had to work for the most part by myself, designing and developing solutions and, of course, maintaining the legacy ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                This means I got the changes to tackle different stacks on the windows ecosystem. I delivered anything from simple console tools, intermediate windows forms and WPF tools solutions to substitute excel worksheets that were starting to bring more overhead than value.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also wrote some code to inter-operate between SharePoint and Umbraco to help ease our migration. In general, my time at the ministry was very important in my development, I gave my first steps with design patterns and got the basics of the SOLID principles and tried a lot of different libraries and tools.
