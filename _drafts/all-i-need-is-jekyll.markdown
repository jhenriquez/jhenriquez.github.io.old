I remember telling a friend some time ago I was going back to blogging and was planning on building a small engine. His advice, after some consideration changed my mind about writing my own thing. He basically argued that blogging being my actual intention I probably was not considering the *energy, time and effort* I'd need to deviate from my original endevour and, in passing, metioned how he started using *Jekyll* at some point for those reasons.

At the time a couple of things motivated me towards the custom solution:

* NodeJS Fever.
* I wanted a personal page AND a blog.


I wanted a fully customizable personal page, preferibly written from scratch. I didn't think any available blogging solution would truely allow me that. So, the basic the idea was to build a simple app with express or hapi that would essentially serve my static web page and provide me some basic content management functionality for a blog. Lets be honest, it didn't sound simple at all. Then again, NodeJS fever :)

How blind I was. Luckily, I remembered my friend's reference to Jekyll. Then, the only thing I knew was that there was some tool with that name and there was support for it on Github Pages. Github Pages? promising enough.
